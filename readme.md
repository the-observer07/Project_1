Connect 4

This is a game of connect 4. It's playable by 2 players. Player 1 will be red and Player 2 will be yellow.

This project was created by myself using HTML, CSS and Javascript languages.
Instead of using a table I used a combination of divs and classes to created the gameboard.

The game is fully functioning.

To run the game locally, open up terminal and execute the index.html file.

Enjoy!
